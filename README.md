<h1 align="center">Not Projects, Routines</h1>

<p>This project integrates with MS Planner to create a plan template, display plans and search plans. This is done through through the MS Graph REST API.</p>

### Display Plans
A simple view of a plan and it's tasks to facilite the use of the other features of this app. For the moment it is readonly since it is intended as a reference to the plans layout.

### Search Plans
Through the MS Planner app you can search a plan for a task but there is no way to search for a task in various plans. This part of the app lets you do just that, the search can find partial names to a task but currently only searchs the name/title of a task.

### Create Template
Currently the template is hard coded into the app, and will permit the user to use a list of names for a set of tasks to be create.

<!-- ## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"npm run build": "react-scripts build"`,

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy!

### `"npm run test": "react-scripts test"`,

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

### `"serve": "node server"`

For running the server file on you can use this command.

### `npm run serve`
